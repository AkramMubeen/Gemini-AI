# Gemini-AI# Projects Using Google's Gemini AI API

This repository showcases two projects developed using Google's advanced Gemini-Pro and Gemini-Vision Pro models.

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System)

The ATS application, built with Streamlit, leverages Google's Gemini-Pro model to assess the match rate between job descriptions and candidate resumes. It offers the following features:

- **Matching Percentage:** Provides a quantitative measure of the match between job descriptions and resumes.
- **Missing Keywords:** Identifies keywords that are absent in the candidate's resume concerning the job description.
- **Summary:** Generates a concise summary of the candidate's application.

## Edited or Not

The "Edited or Not" application, also developed with Streamlit, utilizes Google's Gemini-Pro Vision models to determine whether an image has been edited. Key features include:

- **User Interaction:** Allows users to provide hints to the model by sharing their thoughts on whether the image appears edited.
- **Image Upload:** Enables users to upload images for analysis.
- **Result:** Presents the model's evaluation of whether the image has been edited or not.
